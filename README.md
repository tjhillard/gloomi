## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install && cd client && npm install
```

2. Create `.env` in project root and populate following key:

```
DARKSKY_API_KEY
```

3. Run servers

```
npm run start
```

This should run the express server and then the web server.

```
node server.js
```

```
cd client && npm run start
```

should also work.
